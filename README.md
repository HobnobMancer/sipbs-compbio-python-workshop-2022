# SIPBS CompBio June 2022 Python workshop

Welcome to the repository for the SIPCS CompBio Python workshop.

We will be working through the notebook `SIPBS_python_workshop_June2022.ipynb`. Feel free to add additional notes to notebook, to provide yourself a refernence guide while coding.

## Learning Outcomes
- Define each of the data types in Python and give examples of when they may be used
- Assign data to variables
- Perform basic maths operations using Python
- Use logical and conditional operations to compare data
- Design simple functions
- Load and parse CSV files using `pandas`
- Use a `numpy` array to ..
- Use the `math` module to perform statistical analysis on a dataset

## Introduction

Bioinformatics is concerned with the development of software solutions for processing and interrogating biological data to extract meaningful insights. Python is a general-purpose programming language; it can be used to design software to perform a variety of tasks from statistical analysis and automation, to robotics. Python is also widely used because it is a high-level language. Its syntax (the code we write) is closer to the language that we speak and is easily understood by humans. This also makes it a relatively easier language to learn and implement in our work.

## Requirements

Please ensure you have installed the following:
- `git`
- `Python` >= v3.8
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `sklearn`

## How to use this repository

Use this repo as a starting point to keep a reference or guide book on the methods and code you want to use in your work.

In the workshop we will be practising using `git`. To get started, we will use `git` to get the repo onto your computer. To do this, you will need to:
   1. Create a GitHub account (if you do not already have one)
   2. Create a new repository from this template in your GitHub account
   3. Clone your new repository to your local machine
   - > Use of `git` is beyond the scope of this `README.md` but some links are provided in the `Useful Resources` section, below.
   - > A short guide to creating a new repository and cloning it to your own machine is given in the sections below.

Alternatively, you can create a new repo using this repo as a template, by using the following steps:
1. Log in to GitHub at [`https://github.com`](https://github.com)
2. Use your browser to navigate to the GitHub page for this repository: [https://github.com/sipbs-compbiol/template_bioinformatics_project](https://github.com/sipbs-compbiol/template_bioinformatics_project)
3. Click on the `Use This Template` button
4. Click on the `Owner` drop-down menu, and select the account you would like to own the new repository (this will most likely be your own account)
5. Type the name of the repository you want to create into the `Repository Name` field.
6. Add a short description of your repository (or your project) in the `Description` field.
7. Choose whether your repository should be `Public` (anyone can see or clone it), `Private` (only you and those you authorise can see or clone it), or `Internal` (this is probably not relevant to you, and can be ignored)
8. Click `Create Repository from Template`

This will create a new repository in your `GitHub` account, which should be visible from your account page. You can then clone this repository to your machine, or work with it in the browser.

The official guidance for creating a new repository can be found on GitHub at the link below.
